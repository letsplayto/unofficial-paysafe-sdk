### üì¶ Why this exists

Paysafe currently provides official SDKs for Java, C#, and JavaScript ‚Äî but none for Python.  
This SDK bridges that gap and enables any Python developer to start building with Paysafe *immediately*.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This SDK is **community-maintained** and is **not affiliated with or endorsed by Paysafe**. Use at your own discretion and always test thoroughly in sandbox mode.
